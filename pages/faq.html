          <p>We have a wide range of supplies that can suit all your cosplay repair needs!</p>
					<p>We have 4 main areas: Sewing, Glue, Wig, and General.</p>
					<p>We can assist with ripped seams, undone hems with both needle & thread or machine. For glue fixes, we have low-temp and high-temp hot glue guns, super glue, and epoxy. We also have various tapes like duct tape, fashion tape, electrical tape, and double-sided tape. Additionally, we have glue-knowledgeable staff volunteers to help you if you're not sure what sticky medium to use for foam to plastic adhesion, wood to acrylic, or anything else! We have wig detangling spray, hair spray, bobby pins, clips, and wig thinning scissors. We provide wig heads and mirrors so you can fix droopy Ahoge anime hair strands and less-than-gravity-defying spikes. Our General station has a little bit of everything else.</p>
          <p>The list below is generally what we will bring to every convention as long as supplies last:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hot glue</li>
            <li>Super glue</li>
            <li>Epoxy</li>
            <li>E600</li>
            <li>Sewing machines</li>
            <li>Needle and thread (hand sewing)</li>
            <li>Velcro & Elastics</li>
            <li>Snaps, hooks, and eyes</li>
            <li>Scrap fabrics</li>
            <li>Wig detangler</li>
            <li>Combs</li>
            <li>Bobby pins</li>
            <li>Wig pins</li>
            <li>Sock glue (to keep up knee high socks & et cetera)</li>
            <li>Fashion tape</li>
            <li>Spirit gum</li>
            <li>Duct tape</li>

            <li>Wire</li>

            <li>and last but not least...Pterodactyls (our mascot!)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Our supplies can differ a little from convention to convention and from how often supplies can get used up. If you don't see an item on this list...stop by anyways! We also have some niche items to repair with that we do not list above.</p>
					<p>The best practice is to message us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or email us at <u>cosplayrepair@gmail.com</u> to see what we have at present, or just find us at your convention and ask. We're happy to help.</p>

          <p>Cosplay Repair Station is just that: a <u>repair</u> station.</p>
          <p>We are purely a cosplay and prop repairing volunteer group. Unfortunately, in order to help as many people as possible and maintain supplies for everyone, we cannot do construction because this takes too much time and is out of the scope of our volunteers' responsibilities. We just would not have enough supplies to repair <b>and</b> help everyone finish their costumes. The items we supply are bought solely on the generous donations of convention goers, like you, to ensure repair and not construction.</p>
					<p>If anything wasn't broken to begin with, we will not be able to provide you with help or supplies, sorry! This means no finishing loose hems, styling new wigs, or freshly gluing together your prop in the Cosplay Repair Station. Concrunch is real, we totally get it, but we are unfortunately not able to be the space for you to finish completing your costumes.</p>
          <p>Please keep in mind we try to alot 15 minutes of repair time to each visiting guest in need of repairs. Our job is to help fix your costume as soon as possible so you can go enjoy the con!</p>

					<p>Financial support goes into making sure all our supplies are working, we have enough for each con, and helping with staff transportation. If you would like to know more, feel free to email us at <u>cosplayrepair@gmail.com</u>.</p>

					<p>We reach out to conventions, but since we are a non-profit group we must be hosted by the convention and well...conventions will not host us unless their is a need! So if you think you would love to have a Cosplay Repair Station at your con: message your conventions, @ them, and tell them how much you'd like for us to be there!</p>
          <p>If you are a convention representative and would like to chat with us about having our Cosplay Repair at your con, please also let us know as we would be very happy to discuss!</p>
